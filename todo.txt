Short term:

make a dot function
Add transformations
Make sure 3d roatations work
set graph size relative to screen size???

Long term:
Fix janky way of doing infinate for axis do same idea as grid lines
MAKE SCALE NOT CALCULATED EVERY TIME
Add grid numbers

Add a hard limit to all while loops so it doesn't crash browswer
Change zoom in and out to multiplication

can draw a point on the graph, non scaled

grid edi notes - think of as a mod->increment 
to value and then go back to beginning, where value is the increment when drawing grid

Change rotation:
